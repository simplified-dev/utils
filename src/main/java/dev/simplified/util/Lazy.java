/**
 * A thread-safe memoizing wrapper that defers a value's computation until first access
 * and caches the result for all subsequent reads.
 * <p>
 * The supplied {@link Supplier} is invoked at most once. After {@link #get()} returns,
 * the computed value, including {@code null}, is cached in a {@code volatile} field and
 * returned directly on every later call. Concurrent {@link #get()} callers race on a
 * single {@code synchronized} block guarded by double-checked locking, so the
 * initializer runs exactly once even under contention.
 * <p>
 * This class is appropriate for fields whose construction is non-trivial and whose
 * read frequency is uncertain or skewed. The cost on the warm path is a single volatile
 * read; the cost on the first call is the supplier invocation plus one monitor
 * acquisition. Each instance carries the supplier reference and the cached value, so
 * the memory footprint is approximately three references plus the object header.
 *
 * @param <T> the deferred value type
 * @see Supplier
